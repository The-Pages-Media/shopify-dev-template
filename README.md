## Requirements  
It is recommended for this project to use Shopify CLI 

[Shopify CLI Reference](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli)  
 - [Commands](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands)  
 - [Upgrade](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands#upgrade)
 - [Environments](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/environments)
 
## Get Started
Using the Shopify CLI, can run locally using: 
 
`shopify theme dev -s store-name`
 
_The `-s` is shorthand for `--store`. It should be noted that `.myshopify.com` is not necessary to pass for the store-name._
 
If working out of the the customizer and need to save updated sections use:
 
`shopify theme dev -e -s store-name`
 
_The `-e` is shorthand for `--environment` and works if you create different environments. If we set up different environments you might need to use `--theme-editor-sync` instead but by default without environments set, `-e` will save._
